In the village of love you bring life In your words my heart finds peace at night Everything will be in my home I'm so far from the city My heart is so far from the city My heart is so far from the city My heart is so far from the city My heart is so far from the city My heart is so far from the city My heart is so far from the city My heart is so far from the city

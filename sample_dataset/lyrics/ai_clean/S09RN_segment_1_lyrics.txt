Was it me or fantasy hoping you'd come back from a polygy? Look baby, this was never me, it isn't nor will it ever be. I'll be better than you'll ever see. A contradiction that I will breathe in and out is faster in until we become our own tragedy. It was me, it always was. I try my best to fix this.

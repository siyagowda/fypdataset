Every fish on a wheel, then give me a chance Then call me crazy, send me a ta please But music no bomb by the land, I'll res me So I reggae and the cure, they're reading divine Even a pool of water fish can't skank in a time Me and the reggae fish feast in him Reggae culture, I'm a client of them From the ice to beaches, my voice reach far Is the reggae fish a reggae superstar Me and the reggae fish swimming in a vibe

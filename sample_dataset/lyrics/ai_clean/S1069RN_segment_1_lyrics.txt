Heavens gates Too many sins I can't deny Can't deny Lift me up eyes to what you see There's no love in this heart of mine I would know I've given it all I'll wait Lift me up Heavens gates I year up so I can say There's no peace in the things I say I would know that I'm out of time I would know that I'm out of time

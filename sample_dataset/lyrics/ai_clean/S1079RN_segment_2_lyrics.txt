I'm walking the rivers to a little more weight I don't be okay The more I learn, the better I get I learn from everyone I've met Never think it's a huge surprise I remember most lovers in high-end I was speaking and training Not getting away from rain I got a powerful high-speed brake Nothing makes me down, I'm the man of outtown I'll always try for success I'm wearing that dress I wanna thank you I wanna thank you I wanna thank you

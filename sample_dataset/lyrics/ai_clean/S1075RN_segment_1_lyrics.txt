Wake up, the mess was fun. Now the soul has come undone. We traded chaos for ya. It wasn't fair, it wasn't pure, but at least we kinda knew the score. Now it's vibe, melancholy theme. Burnt him just for you. Yeah sure. Ding dong, the trendings gone, which old mess the juicy one. Ding dong, the bots have left the room. No more fights or shady bumps.

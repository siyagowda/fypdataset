I used to sit till I blacked out Used to wake up and just laugh about it Now I sit slow because I know what it's like to wake up with regrets in the past Around me used to be broke but I never did notice His phone was the only concern Now I got goals and I know what it takes every dollar is something to earn Back in the day we was flexin' like we was immortal Now I'd be saving for houses and neck when he lookin' at Morgan's formal Used to just live for the now, you still ignore every sign Now when I see opportunities knocking on open doors in my mind I used to take it for granted

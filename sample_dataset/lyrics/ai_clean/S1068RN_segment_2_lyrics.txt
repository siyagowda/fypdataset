Think it forever was real Now I just look at my circle and see how did time they subscribe that won't heal We used to sit in the whip and just dream about the things that we bought when we rich Now when we talk it's about all the struggles and taxes and raising our kids Life used to move like a party Now I just move like a test Used to be nice full of bottles Now I just cherish the moments of rest Used to be fears that we never do nothing Now we just fear to be peaked Funny how life got a way of just changing the game underneath of our feet And this is how you stand And this is how you stand Like Watch holes Go go go goometerREAM camp

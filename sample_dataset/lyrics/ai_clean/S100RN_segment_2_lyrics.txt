As long as the sun still shines on us And the night doesn't drown us and shadows rebirth On those in the dark and those in the light Let's open our hearts and unite tonight Let's open our eyes and tear down the walls The warmness goes with a love that comes We are the light, the hope that's laid And time this will heal though

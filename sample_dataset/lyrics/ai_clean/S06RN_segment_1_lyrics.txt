M-HC becomes the last in the heads off One stems me toes, I see stars, I see God Uselage pain, it cracks, down I go flat on the ice My courage can't accursion, me, she by the twine And now I'm running late, me socks are soaked in blood I stare into the mirror, I look like a pump of mud Tired as a news, ugly as hell, smellin' like a rat But the stock will take them back, I got your crew just like that

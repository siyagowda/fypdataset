from his absinches. He wishes he was here, but the real ones get hurt every time that he is near. He's a lover, not a fighter, but he can do jujitsu, so don't force him in a corner or you'll need more than a tissue. He is underneath your bed, waiting as you fall asleep, and he'll hand you to the Lord, the lost cause your soul to keep. His face is like an octet. One lovecraft alone could love. He just wants to be a special boy. For daddy, caffuloo above. He may not be around. He may be working on a sound, but if you feel himself destructive... You can talk to frowns.

I'm with you, the good light Every second that ticked the past is being written So for the future to stick with you Remember winning, feel like I'm wasting the present by sleeping dream and sitting What hard do the days to rob be late nights written This young chick's picture to who be late nights dripping To pay bill, put food on a table, pay off the whistle This week's dream about the good life too No one will know that in the room for assholes It's right to do the stuff to do That we pay alone away to paradise We these kids are saved up when they have the freedom

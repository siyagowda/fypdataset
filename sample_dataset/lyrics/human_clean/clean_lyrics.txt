The muscle, him who won the bigger, embedded, no matter the weather, rain or shine on the grind, he let him defeat your mind. Just keep your purpose in mind, pin your focus on sight. Sometimes you gotta fight for your rights, a lit, despite the fact they don't want to see you achieve a sandflash of green, final strength within. It's all on you at the end of the day. At the end of the day, it's all right. It's just not going your way, the future's still right. As long as you stay on the beach, you don't make it. Take that mold and break it.

You can talk to do the same stuff to the universe, and that is the effect. Everything you use, in the form, will step at the Museum.

If you need to go to the laboratory or to replenish food or water supplies, do not stay outside your refuge for a second longer than is necessary. After 48 hours, the danger from sexy hair will lessen, but you could still be risking your life by exposure to it. Visit outside the house, man. First, be-

But I care about my car. Little blue things a week or long, and a bicycle horn, 30 years young. Little blue thing in my dreams. Speed around no effort, or gas hardly. Simplicity in white, blue way, with a gang sign painted from the sun. Backward turning pages, urinating in mice.

Remember we all fight out, Get up the fool's room out, Break up every leg, You've got that life for yourself. Show them my soul parts into the light, I'm drawn for in my head. How can you worship a god? We said it, So I thought that's it said. Show them my soul parts into the light, I'm drawn for in my head. Show them my soul parts into the light, I'm drawn for in my head. Show them my soul parts into the light, I'm drawn for in my head. Show them my soul parts into the light, I'm drawn for in my head. Show them my soul parts into the light, I'm drawn for in my head.

The skies were so blue they looked like paint. The grasses under our feet were so lush. The water of the lakes and rivers so twinkling, but Dick Cheney's penis is not heaven. We came to understand our plight. The fact no one can hear our cries or hear the discharge of our weapons or the way we honk the horns of the buses that were stranded inside Dick Cheney's penis. It seems we were among the last groups of people to enter these hallowed.

Barks getting white, been striped in height, There's a flavor of a tight, with gimmicks and market angles Burnin' flames like the bangles, But by no means eternal campaigns, With the tunnel till its bust down the urinal And frontal stenches, on the benches, Reckonsumers, yee-ya-me-yets, The player for the sponsors, And commercial tight concerts, Concerns only dwelling on charts and hit singles, But a lifetime of rhyme kept me stung in a jingle, And tensions sound inventions, they have steppers, Never felt the vibe, but even tried to fit the vibe, Commitin' no noses, use the phonos to forge fodges, Hordes from here, and abroad, just not in the plot,

vaginal rant. Why draftsman? Why is an agenda neutral suffix that can fix itself to align with grace, not applaud around on heavy boots announcing its place?

Just that I asked my baby, how come the sex is always so much better after you've come? And she just looked at me angrily. What's up with that? So I always knew that the Durix brand tropical condom was going to be luscious due to the warning on the outer packaging, and that it would protect me from lesions.

Question it, pessimist, dissonist, to elemental specialists is excellent. Whether you like it or not, we got this gone dine, love for the music, hip hop. So we rock, overbeat, sing your favorite spot. Real talk when I'm taking my shots. So what you got? Drama, something I can do without, no doubt. We all got a bounce, my thoughts are focused on the next level. The next stage we're spoken, integrate spirit in your action. Few are chosen with the passion that can never be broken. Love is the will that perpetuates compassion, because life's too short to let it drift. So we aim in.

I can feel the coast I cast as over. I can feel the coast I cast as over. I can feel the coast I cast as over.

And here I am, I realize, I'm a mirror, but what you're making does? I'm going to the world, kill, cry like you, and I know you won't keep me, Like I do. You think, that the stage, when you see me again, You don't seem the same, and the past is a blame. This future is our future, this time's on the game. This time, you're a significant, always on your own, When this company tells, it has to mine itself, For it's not me, someone else, You left it all, life's only because of your bad.

One digital file at a time, leaving their musical dreams and helplessly snared in this worldwide web of theft and indifference. Why don't you think my collection's complete?

I never took a challenge, never tried hard, And never played, to afraid of failing. This is madness. I always went across the path of the heart, then. The story ends there screaming a frighten, That because of justice, the bond of it, I could just open the door, If you walk in until I reach the peak of a mountain, Is it a crime by my speed boy? None of us is cross.

no conception of the conspiracy strategy of pressures from above and pressure from below. They have no idea that they're playing into the hands of the establishment they claim to hate. And don't realize that it is precisely such forces which are behind their own revolution, financing it and using it for their own purposes. More and more young radicals are beginning to wake up to the fact that their entire lives have been carefully programmed by the very people who are their hate symbols. I don't know what to do about this.

The evil thing, man who says this is sublime, cannot mean I have sublime feelings.

This place, these ghosts, these people stranded, waterlogged and empty-handed, decimation and destruction. Preparations, not enough, when land curls up of water rolls, death poles and tears. A panic threat for deep-bears founded, founder of the sea. A nation is honest, we must. How to find balance on a flock of shaking, breaking with his ground, is how to be winked with water.

Please leave me alone. I'm just looking for the peace. I can't find a home. And all I really want is to enjoy my trick. Let my mind rest. Let my heart flick. Stand up, stagger, then grab my coat. Step into the rain, fresh air burns my throat. Dark and still, something shines in the shadows. The illusion was in cold like my soul was grown.

A spiritual being, not caught up in material things that we are thinking Can't see me

I don't like an asshole, touch my radio, extreme acts of an excess duty. I don't give a fuck what you want to listen to. You only hear the best, any less is a felony. Boy, that you must prove, I don't matter, be without boy, yours, I don't think it's a five-a-go, through twelve-hour, when I listen to lies. The new flaws, malice, imitate, that you got the brand new release from a thousand-year-old fat. Crastic still, fashion, young, all-craned debates, when I hear a hot-blood. Paul, Oaks, Millie, Tadilly, you say Oaks, I say Dilly, Caribbean Queen.
